## Docker

If for some strange reason you would want to run this inside a container GitHub Actions automatically builds an image and stores it in the GitHub Container Registry on every PR to master.

### GitHub Actions

To download the image you must first login to (Docker Container Registry)[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages] and then do:

```
docker pull peterbb148/cx-boilerplate-react
docker run -it -p 8080:80 peterbb148/cx-boilerplate-react
```
Which will start a container based on the image and attach to the running container to show console logs.

### Create Image Locally

docker build . --tag cx-boilerplate-react:latest
```
To push the image to Docker Hub run this:
```
docker tag cx-boilerplate-react:latest peterbb148/cx-boilerplate-react:latest
